# Hi, I'm Carlos!

As a manager, it's important for my team as well as my peers to know what I value, what I expect of them, and what they can expect of me. I'm writing this document to define my philosophy, set clear expectations, and emphasize my values. I expect to change this document over time, and I welcome feedback on how I can make it clearer and more valuable.
